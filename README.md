## Description
I have made a procedurally generated pixel heart beating animation where the background color changes with each beat of the heart, and there is a blue toned rain happening behind the hearts. Through the use of the spacebar hotkey, I am able to switch between the two frames of animation to simulate a beating heart, as well as switch between randomized background colors. With the use of the backspace or shift hotkey, I can make the screen become full screen. To exit out of the full screen, I press either one of those hotkeys again. Each pixel of color in each heart is procedurally placed and shaped by using x and y coordinates. There are 7 generated colors that I chose to use for this piece: pinks 1 through 5, white, and black. The small heart consists of 18 generated rectangles while the big heart consists of 26 generated rectangles.
