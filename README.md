## Description
I have made a procedurally generated pixel heart beating animation with rainbow letter rain and a rainbow strobe background. Through the use of the spacebar hotkey, I am able to switch between the two frames of animation to simulate a beating heart. With the use of the backspace or shift hotkey, I can make the screen become full screen. To exit out of the full screen, I press either one of those hotkeys again. Each pixel of color in each heart is procedurally placed and shaped by using x and y coordinates. There are 7 generated colors that I chose to use for this piece: pinks 1 through 5, white, and black. The small heart consists of 18 generated rectangles while the big heart consists of 26 generated rectangles. The rainbow letter rain changes between randomly generated uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as each letter being assigned a random RGB color. I used a rainbow strobing effect for the background that generates random RGB scale colors.
