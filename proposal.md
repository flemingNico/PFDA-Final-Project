# Procedurally Generated Sprite Animation

## Repository
<https://github.com/flemingNico/PFDA-Final-Project.git>

## Description
My final project will be a short sprite animation that will be completely procedurally generated. It will be a totally new kind of animation style because none of it is physically drawn or painted; it will all be generated procedurally.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Change background color and set up window size.
- Feature 2
	- Make simplistic sprites out of procedurally generated shapes in window.
- Feature 3 
	- Switch between sprites to create the illusion of movement.

## Challenges
- I need to learn how to make more than 2 frames of animation.
- I might need to learn how to generate more than just rectangles.
- I need to learn how to loop my animation.
- I need to learn how to set the fps to play without keyboard input.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Several frames of procedurally generated animation in a flipbook style in a new window. I could either do a running animation or a bouncing ball animation.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- At least 2 frames of animation that flow together to create a rough animation within the specified window. (I could make a twinkling heart, a wave sequence, or a person blinking)

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Learn how to display more than 2 frames of animation with at least 8 frames.
  2. Set up window in which animation will play and set its solid background.

- Week 2
  1. Set up frames of animation by procedurally generating particles.
  2. Research RGB values for colors in animation.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Finish setting up frames through procedural generation.
  2. Learn how to loop that animation to play several times until quit.
